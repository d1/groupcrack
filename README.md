Groupcrack 
==========
Software to manage and promote group addictions.

There are so many ways to communicate and form groups on the internet, but in many ways, 
each solution does not always fit the needs of a group that meets face to face. 
Group organizers should not have to rely solely on mailing lists, Facebook, Google Groups, 
or any other social network that is not tailored to fit their needs, nor should they be 
required to pay a fee to a software as a service company for every organization that is created. Groupcrack is being built to meet and go beyond the needs of people who meet face to face, within a multi-tenant platform. 
Using a remote web server with a single domain name, Groupcrack can be installed and customized to host as many organizations within the same domain name as desired.

This application is initially being built to target a basic VPS installation. 
Eventually a scaled back version that can be run on free hosting services, specifically Heroku, will be developed.
Host as many groups within the same site, and scale your hosting plan as you get more traffic. 
Designing new features that meet your needs as you grow is what Groupcrack is all about.

**Groupcrack is the code name for this project while it is still in the development process. When this software is ready for a 1.0 release, it will most likely be renamed to something more marketing friendly.**
